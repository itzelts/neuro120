An fMRI dataset for whole-body somatotopic mapping in humans
====================
Note: This dataset is compatible with the BIDS v1.3.0-dev as a standalone derivative dataset. 
Due to that the OpenNeuro.org does not support the BIDs v1.3.0 yet ('desc-<label>' in file names), 
a made-up subject 'sub-phantom' was created only to pass the data stucture validation for uploading dataset.
